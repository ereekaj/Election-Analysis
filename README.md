# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 
I've already been working with the Colorado Board of Elections to complete an audit of one of their elections. The results have been submitted but now the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit.  The purpose of this election audit analysis will be to use the same data used in the previous audit to determine the following information:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results: 
The screenshot below shows the results of the election audit in the terminal. These results can also be found in the text file [Election_Analysis.txt](https://github.com/ereekaj/Election-Analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt).

## Election-Audit Summary: 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
