# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 
I've already been working with the Colorado Board of Elections to complete an audit of one of their elections. The results have been submitted but now the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit.  The purpose of this election audit analysis will be to use the same data used in the previous audit to determine the following information:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

## Election-Audit Results: 

- *How many votes were cast in this congressional election?* In this particular election 369,711 votes were cast. 

- *Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.*
- *Which county had the largest number of votes?*
- *Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.*
- *Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?*

## Election-Audit Summary: 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
